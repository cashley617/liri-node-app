# liri-node-app

This is Liri. 

Liri is a Command Line Application to simplify your life. Instead of jumping between applications, you can use LIRI to search Spotify for your favorite song, OMDB for your favorite movie, and Bands In Town for venue details. 

This App is organized first by required packages, then global variables, and finally functions. 

Open your Terminal and navigate to the project. 

To search Spotify: Type node liri.js concert-this <artist/>band name here>

To search OMDB: Type node liri.js movie-this <"movie name here">

To search for a concert: Type node liri.js concert-this <artist/>band name here>

If you get bored, type: node liri.js do-what-it-says 


I am the sole contributor to this project. 

Liri uses axios, fs, keys, moment, and Spotify.
