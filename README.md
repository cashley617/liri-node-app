# This is Liri. 

Liri is a Command Line Application to **simplify** your life. Instead of jumping between applications, you can use LIRI to search Spotify for your favorite song, OMDB for your favorite movie, and Bands In Town for venue details. 

I am the sole contributor to this project. 

###### The App
This App is organized first by required packages, then global variables, and finally functions. 

###### To use it:
Open your Terminal and navigate to the project. 

* To search Spotify: Type node liri.js concert-this <artist/>band name here>

* To search OMDB: Type node liri.js movie-this <"movie name here">

* To search for a concert: Type node liri.js concert-this <artist/>band name here>

* If you get bored, type: node liri.js do-what-it-says 

###### The packages: 
Liri uses:
* axios 
* fs 
* keys 
* moment 
* Spotify
